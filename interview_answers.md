# Interview Answers

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What problem does the context API help solve? Passing state to child components

2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

Action is an object that stores the information about an assigned data type. Reducers are used to accept actions and decipher the data received. And store is an object that holds our application's state.

3. What does `redux-thunk` allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
   redux-thunk is a middleware that allows you to return functions, rather than just actions

4. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

I prefered using context API because it's way easier to learn and put in practice, it also allows state managment on a lighter and less intimidating way.
